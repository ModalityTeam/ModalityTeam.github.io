notes: |
  All controls (incl. push buttons) fully programmable in the device by channel, type, number.

  Absolute and relative controller modes, and 14 bit high resolution encoder mode for sensitive parameters.

  Programmable value ranges with min/max values, and data feedback for encoders and faders avoid value jumps.

  MIDI in and out ports feature routing and merge functionality.
