notes: |
  Uses default presets.

  Every key was mapped, with the exception of ```Prog Change```.

  Accidental ```Prog-Change``` activation on the device needs to be reverted by ```Bank A/B```.

  For more flexibility use the [MPK MiniMKII editor](http://www.akaipro.com/product/mpk-mini-mkii#downloads).
